# Supermarket-list-ElectronJS
electronJS based application which has a customizable window
npm install 
npm  run package-mac

## Installation

To install prebuilt Electron binaries, use [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/).
The preferred method is to install Electron as a development dependency in your
app:

```sh
npm install electron --save-dev [--save-exact]
```

The `--save-exact` flag is recommended for Electron prior to version 2, as it does not follow semantic
versioning. As of version 2.0.0, Electron follows semver, so you don't need `--save-exact` flag. For info on how to manage Electron versions in your apps, see
[Electron versioning](docs/tutorial/electron-versioning.md).

For more installation options and troubleshooting tips, see
[installation](docs/tutorial/installation.md).

## Quick start & Electron Fiddle

Use [`Electron Fiddle`](https://github.com/electron/fiddle)
to build, run, and package small Electron experiments, to see code examples for all of Electron's APIs, and
to try out different versions of Electron. It's designed to make the start of your journey with
Electron easier.

Alternatively, clone and run the
[electron/electron-quick-start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start)
repository to see a minimal Electron app in action:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start
cd electron-quick-start
npm install
npm start
```
